## Intro
This week our group found three datasets from distinct fields. 

## Data 1: Young Adult Migration 
Data source link: https://migrationpatterns.org/

This data tracks the people born in the U.S. between 1984 and 1992 where they lived at the age of 16 and where they live at the age of 24. 

Dataset has ~13 million samples and its parameters are:

  - origin commuting zone (o_cz)
  
  - o_state
  
  - destination commuting zone (d_cz)
  
  - d_state
  
  - parental income quantile
  
  - race
  
  - number of people from o now living in d
  
  - number of people living in d
  
  - number of people from o
  
Research Questions:

  - Which city is the most popular for young adult immigrants?
  
  - Which city has the most young adults who want to move out?
  
  - What parameters influence the immigration decisions? (race, parents income, other datasets maybe education level, married, city GDP, government policy, tax rate, weather)

  - indicator

and more 

Research Questions: 

  - Which region of the world has the largest proportion of homicide cases?

  - What parameters influence the homicide rate? (country GDP, government policy, tax rate, education level, etc.)
