<p><font size="5"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p>Human migration is a complex yet insightful behavior that offers us valuable information regarding why humans would migrate, and what factors influence human migration.In this project, we aimed to investigate whether the crime rate of the individual states would impact the migration pattern of the residents in the United States. We hoped to find out whether the increased crime rate in individual states would lead more residents moving out of the state, and less residents moving into the state.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is: <b>Residents in the states with high crime rates would be more likely to migrate out of the state. Simultaneously, states with high crime rates would attract fewer migrants.</b></p>
<p>The reason why we chose to investigate such a topic is that crime rate is closely related with public security and economical development of certain states. On a personal level, it is significantly associated with the educational environment, employment rate, and the overall life quality of the local residents. Generating meaningful results would inform and educate the public, as well as advocating necessary social changes and policy formulation to promote the socioeconomic development of the states in the US. On one hand, by accessing the association between migration pattern and crime rate, residents who intend to migrate would receive implication on the environment of their potential destinations, assisting them in making more informed decisions according to their personal goal. Additionally, the state government would receive quality insights in residential behaviors, stimulating them to design and implement effective policies to foster social development, such as making an effort in improving public security. In addition to directly intervening with the crime rate, the state government might also aim to improve educational resources, employment opportunities, and decrease tax revenue, as all of which might be associated with decreased crime rate. Moreover, we took race and income level into account for a more comprehensive understanding on the association between crime rate and migration pattern. It is possible that the increased crime rate is associated with low income or a specific race, which influence the strength of the association between crime rate and migration pattern and provide insights on the difference of such association between different race and income level. Also, we selected two specific crime rates, robbery and burglary, to analyze their individual associations with the migration pattern. It would help to inform the local government on focusing what type of crime rate while formulating policies. Understanding and communicating the combined result would further inform the public and government on the factors that lead to high crime rate, and the difference of the decision making and behaviors among people with different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
