<font size="5"><b>Introduction to Our Datasets</b></font>


Primary: https://migrationpatterns.org/ (Migration Trend)


Secondary: https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime (Crime Data)


Third: https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/colleges-and-universities/explore?location=-47.131994%2C-13.943369%2C5.65&showTable=true. (US colleges and Universities)


  When we first started the project, we tried to explore what parameters influence the migration decisions (race, parental income, educational level, marriage, city GDP, government policy, tax rate, weather). There are lots of datasets that study the migration trend. We specifically focus on the migration trend of the young adults from age 16-26. The migration datasets we use is mainly constructed by three organizations: Policy Impacts, Opportunity Insights and United States Census Bureau to analyze the migration between teenager and young adulthood. 


  Looking more closely into the data collection process, the data about location at age 16 and 26 is assigned using Census, tax, and HUD information. Child race is measured using information from the 2010 Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS). Parental income is measured as a 5-year average of family income when the children are aged 14-18 based on the tax form 1040 of the parent who claims them as a dependent.  


  The second dataset contains crime rate with various crime types in 2000 - 2007 (except 2004) and 2010 - 2017. The dataset is obtained from the FBI website in the hate crime category and is collected and constructed by FBI. We hope to find out how change of the crime rate would impact the migration patterns in the United States. Additionally, we are interested in finding out whether other variables would moderate the association between migration pattern and crime rate, such as parental income level, race, and the geographic locations. By combining two datasets and the variables, we finalize our research question: how different parameters affect the migration pattern and their relationship with others. 


  Our third dataset is US colleges and universities. The dataset comes from Opendatasoft website. The Colleges and Universities feature is composed of all Post Secondary Education facilities as defined by the data from Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS) and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the school year 2018-2019,  including 'Doctoral/Research Universities', 'Masters Colleges and Universities', 'Baccalaureate Colleges', 'Associates Colleges', 'Theological Seminaries', 'Medical Schools and Other Health Care Professions', 'Schools of Engineering and Technology', 'Business and Management', 'Art, Music, Design', 'Law Schools', 'Teachers Colleges', 'Tribal Colleges', and 'Other Specialized Institutions'.


  While crime rate is an important factor for people deciding to move out, we also want to look at factors that can attract people at the age ~ 16-26 who may move from their home states to other states for their univeristies. Therefore, we find this dataset containing the number of universities in each state and explore its association with the migration patterns.

<font size="5"><b>Variables</b></font>

The migration dataset contains 11 variables. 

Geographic variables: 

* origin commuting zone (o_cz) : commuting zone (CZ) in which the individual resided /at age 16
* O_state : The name of the state the origin CZ is in.
* destination commuting zone (d_cz): CZ in which the individual resides at age 26
* D_state: The name of the state the origin CZ is in.


Migration variables : 

* n: The number of individuals from origin o living in destination d.
* n_tot_o: Total number of individuals from origin o. 
* n_tot_d: Total number of individuals who live in destination d. 
* pr_d_o: Pr{D|O}. The probability an individual lives in destination d given they grew up in origin o
* pr_o_d: Pr{O|D}. The probability an individual is from origin o given they live in destination d


Categorical variables:

* parental income quantile (Q1-Q5)
* race (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, Other)


The crime dataset contains 13 variables, including different kinds of hate crime, such as violent crime, property crime,robbery, burglary, etc. 

We use 3 variables from the dataset: 

*	State (50 in total)
*	Number of robbery cases by states (numeric) in two ranges: 2000- 2007 (except 2004), 2010-2017.
*	Number of burglary cases by states (numeric) in two ranges: 2000- 2007 (except 2004), 2010-2017.

We specifically choose robbery and burglary from all hate crimes because they are measured in every years, whereas other crime types have missing data that may influence the consistency of statistical analysis.


The US colleges and Universities dataset contains 45 variables, including name of schools, geographical information of each schools, the NAICS_DESC(different type of schools), school website, valid date, number of enrolled students, number of employees, number of housing, etc. Overall, this data layer covers all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico and other assorted U.S. territories.


The main variables we use for our project are:

* State, County, Country, which are are all geographic information of the school
* NAICS_DESC represents the school type defined by National Center for Education Statistics(NCES)
   *Fine Arts School, 
   *Business and Secretarial School, 
   *Computer Training, 
   *Educational Support Services, 
   *Flight Training,
   *Cosmetology and Barber schools,
   *Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools 
   *Junior  Colleges, 
   *Technical and Trade Schools.
